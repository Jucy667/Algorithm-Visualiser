# 📦 Algorithm Visualiser

## 👋 A bit about me and the project

> Hi, my name is Chan and I am an A Level Mathematics/Computer science Student currently studying at Gower College Swansea. I developed this tool as a part of my Algorithm Visualiser Internship with University of South Wales. I wanted to make this tool as easy to use and interactive so that even beginners can understand simple algorithms and their functions.
