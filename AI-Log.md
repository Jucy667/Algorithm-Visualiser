# AI usage log

> Note: All code within this project was written by me and not generated by AI. I have only used AI to help debug and spot errors in my code or to help me learn how to use the matplotlib package.


## ChatGPT

Generated a README template
- Changed project name.
- Changed project description.
- Added an Acknowledgments subheading.
- Everything apart from the template is not AI generated content.

## Copilot

Helped fix an issue where the visualisation disappeared once the list was sorted (It suggest copy and pasting the graph plotting code outside the outer loop so that once the loop ends the graph will be plotted again and untouched by any other code).

Fixed an issue where the next sorting visualiser wouldn't render in. (It suggested to use the plt.pause() function)

Gave suggestions for the colour of my graphs and the python names for the colours (dodgerblue, orange, limegreen)
